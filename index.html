</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>In the early part of my career, I focused on collaborative, community-centered emergency management, counterterrorism, and disaster resilience. While I extensively used user- and human-centered methods and occasionally performed UX and communication design along with copywriting and technical writing, product management and requirements analysis work during this time, it wasn&#39;t until business school that I saw the true value of design. Since then, my concentration has been on using design methods and approaches to drive value in businesses and other large, complex organizations. Across omnichannel experience strategy &mdash; AKA service design, product and UX design, communications design and content strategy, or simply tackling traditional management consulting challenges using human-centered design, I&#39;ve become an award-winning and sought-after practitioner, collaborator, leader, facilitator, instructor, and coach leveraging design, Lean Startup, and agile.</p>

<p>Now focused on enabling organizations to build in-house capability and transforming to become design-led, I live at the intersection of innovation strategy and the digital enterprise. Passionately guiding clients as they find their own success delivering world class product and service experiences that real-world problems, I aim to inspire teams to build user-centered solutions that drive sustainable value and competitive advantage. After all, today we know that design-led companies outperform the S&amp;P 500 by more than 200%.<sup><a style="color:white;" data-toggle="modal" href="#portfolioModal9"><u>1</u></a></sup></p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-6">
<p>I draw from a wide range of experiences when designing solutions for clients and facilitating them through the innovation process. My toolkit is informed by experience responding to and managing disasters and emergencies, teaching children and teenagers how to sail, my MBA, my experience as a digital marketing entrepreneur, my love of design and design methods, and more: the entirety of my three-plus decades on this earth. My educational background enables me to select and apply the most appropriate design methods to solve a given challenge, ensure that solutions result in positive ROI and are aligned with business operations, and professionally manage the transformation needed to realize and enable the future state. Simultaneously, as a digital native (I launched my first social media marketing consultancy in 2004) that has worked with organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 50s and spent time working with limited means in government emergency response, I know how to maximize available resources through lean and agile approaches in order to get things done effectively and efficiently.</p>

<p>This portfolio site is <i>always</i> a work in progress and to be honest (I absolutely believe in radical transparency), I&#39;m never really happy with it&#39;s state: the best way to understand my work is to spend some time allowing me to take you through it.

My toolkit is informed by experience responding to and managing disasters and emergencies, teaching children and teenagers how to sail, my MBA, my experience as a digital marketing entrepreneur, my love of design and design methods, and more: the entirety of my three decades on this earth.

I live at the intersection of innovation strategy and the digital enterprise. My passion for "finding the gap," synthesizing the unmet needs that comprise this capability or experience gap - amounting to the opportunity for innovation, and putting the right people in the right environment to fill the gap, leads to transformational solutions that drive sustainable value and competitive advantage.

<h2>Omnichannel Customer Service</h2><br>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong>
<br>Recently, a private equity-funded retail extended service contract provider facing disruption from a digitally-savvy new entrant engaged us to perform a competitive customer experience benchmarking study, including contextual inquiry, and design <strong>a future state service model that allows the client to leapfrog it&#39;s competitors&#39; customer experience.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Approach</strong>
<br>In order to identify customer pain points and unmet needs, we examined segmentation data to identify customer archetypes of focus and then conducted ethnographic research, performed heuristic assessments of each channel (in-store, contact center, web, social, and mobile), and quantitatively analyzed complaint verbatims. Next, we developed personas and documented the current state in journey maps highlighting opportunities for innovation. Leveraging the results of our research, we facilitated our stakeholders and sponsors through an innovation workshop to design the future state omnichannel experience. Finally, we worked with the client to detail the people, process, and technology capabilities required to enable the future-state, conducted a gap analysis, and developed a roadmap to guide implementation of the new capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>
<br>Shown here is a quick, &lt;5 minute mockup I created during a meeting with our client-side executive sponsor to ensure that we were accurately understanding a potential concept they were describing.</p>

<h2>Homebanking Website</h2><br>
</div>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/Thunderbolt-Display-big.png" />
<p>I was lead business designer and strategist for a web redesign engagement for Banco de Credito del Peru (BCP). BCP realized that despite their leading market share and 125 years of history, foreign banks were muscling in to the local market and in many cases were deploying world-class digital customer service, therefore becoming a compelling choice for the local banked population. In order to provide a seamless experience in the web channel we were engaged to <strong>understand customer needs and provide a differentiated homebanking website that drives business value. </strong><br />
<br />
Here I oversaw the business strategy workstream which entailed conducting a competitive audit, serving as advocates for customers while ensuring creative assets aligned with key performance indicators, enabling the client to implement new business processes, and developing a quantitative business case. My other roles included workshop facilitation and rapid prototyping.<br />
<br />
BCP produced <a style="color:Gray;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y71PL9TMStA" target="_blank">this video</a> to introduce the new ViaBCP, their hombanking portal that my team designed, the homepage of which is shown here.</p>

<h2>A Design Process</h2><br>
</div>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/Shatzkamer_Design_Process.png" />
<p>I began a second master&#39;s degree program, this time in Design &amp; Technology, at SUNY Polytechnic in 2014. This is the result of an assignment to create an infographic depicting a design process from my visual design course at SUNY. Both my design process and technical skill has evolved significantly since creating this infographic but this remains a good example of some of my early work. Here, because I often focus on design for business innovation, I illustrate how my process aligns with the product life cycle to ensure that new products are ready to ship just as the previous iteration begins to decline. Yes, the image appears to be cut off, this is intentional to illustrate how the process is constantly repeating.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve since left the program at SUNY Polytechnic so that I can take graduate level design courses across offerings both in the NYC area and around the world without being tied to a single school&#39;s offerings. Taking advantage of this, I&#39;ve since completed such coursework from sources ranging from Stanford&#39;s d.school to NYU Tisch&#39;s ITP program and beyond. <!--A recent assignment at school was to create an infographic depicting a design process. Here is the deliverable, a diagram of the design process that I tend to use. I thought this would be a good first example as it <strong>demonstrates technical skill as well as my human-centered, iterative methodology.</strong> Because I often focus on design for business innovation, I also illustrate how my process aligns with the product life cycle to ensure that new products are ready to ship just as the previous iteration begins to decline.
<br><br>
To me, <strong>design is a problem-solving method focused on solving actual human needs.</strong> I'm well equipped to conduct contextual inquiry to gain an understanding of unmet needs and experience gaps, facilitate collaborative idea generation and prioritization/selection, create initial prototypes, test and refine solutions, and bring them to market. I also work closely with other designers and human factors engineers focused on industrial, visual, and user experience design throughout the process, as well as production artists and model makers to create high fidelity prototypes and production models, to ensure aesthetic appeal and optimal usability.--></p>

<h2>White Glove Employee Experience</h2><br>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/Anthony2Finalcopy.png" />
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>
<br>Half a billion dollars was the size of the prize when a leading alternative investment firm was looking to outsource non-core activities across facilities, HR, IT, and finance &amp; accounting while retaining and enhancing the high-touch model that made them such an attractive employer. Complicating this challenge was the desire to achieve economies of scale where personal relationships have historically driven getting things done for this client.<br />
<br />
<strong>Approach & Solution</strong>
<br>The team leading this pursuit, intended to result in a joint venture to provide these services on an outsourced basis to both the client/JV partner firm as well as similar alternative investment managers, brought me in to lead the design of the future state employee experience, leveraging technology to provide world-class, white glove service to employees while retaining the ability to scale. Design research was crucial here, given the client&#39;s unique culture, approaches to conducting business, and their emphasis on radical transparency. This work resulted in identification of multiple employee journeys spanning recruitment and initial awareness of the client as a potential employer through to retirement and beyond, focused on their interactions getting help with facilities management, hiring and onboarding, IT support, and more. As a service designer, I also worked with the team and the client to identify and illustrate the back end processes, organizational elements, and technology required to enable this front-end experience vision, as illustrated via a suite of journey maps and service blueprints.<br />
<br />
Discrete innovations comprising these journeys included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An Apple Genius Bar-type lounge where employees could get assistance ranging from booking conference rooms and arranging for meeting catering, setting up new laptops and smartphones, and even to budgeting and procurement.</li>
	<li>A self-service technology vending machine allowing employees to get new computer peripherals, chargers, and more with a swipe of their employee ID card.</li>
	<li>A Siri-like app and voice interface, called Anthony, empowering employees to get assista`nce via self-service with little effort expended. A comp of this Anthony interface that I designed is shown here.</li>
	<li>A robotic video interview tool to perform initial candidate screening resulting in reduced employee turnover and regrettable attrition - key pain points for the client</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Results</strong>
<br>Ultimately, we were awarded the work, beating out much more well-known competitors. I stayed on this effort part-time to guide iterative service design and omnichannel experience visioning in the outsourcing transition phase. It is planned that I will serve as Chief Innovation Officer post-go live with responsibility for continuous needfinding, innovation, and design strategy and execution to ensure that interactions with enabling functions always surprise and delight every employee.</p>

<h2>Paying Suppliers On Time</h2><br>
</div>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/MyVIP - Home copy 2.png" />
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>
<br>I was recently engaged by a Fortune 100 consumer products firm to help them fix their Procure to Pay (P2P) processes using design. My client was struggling to pay vendors on time despite unilaterally imposing Net 120 Day payment terms on all it&#39;s suppliers and wondered whether accounts payable (AP) processes were the culprit. Rather than taking a traditional, Lean Six Sigma approach to solving this challenge, we combined these quantitative methods with design thinking to ensure that the needs of all involved users will be met. I led this engagement including overseeing the work of multiple business analysts and functional SMEs as well as managing the client relationship.<br />
<br />
<strong>Approach & Solution</strong>
<br>Shortly after kicking off this effort, user research indicated that upstream processes, amounting to the entirety of P2P, must be considered in order to reach a successful conclusion. I negotiated with the client to expand our scope and then extended our user research efforts across P2P to cover external vendors, internal buyers and requisitioners (those that require goods and services), through to the AP team. User research resulted in development of user personas and a summary of opportunities to improve and innovate which were presented to client stakeholders and sponsor users in a design thinking workshop. I subsequently facilitated participants through building user empathy, generating, prioritizing, and selecting the most promising ideas, and finally describing these impactful and feasible ideas via concepts that would solve our users pain and help <strong>ensure that vendors get paid on time, every time.</strong><br />
<br />
Next, while I worked to illustrate this aspirational future state through a suite of user journey and process maps, my team of SMEs and analysts aligned our concepts to business value to create a prioritized and phased implementation roadmap. <strong>Appearing first on the roadmap is a multi-sided portal in which vendors can create and submit compliant invoices, recieve orders, track payment progress, and get help</strong> while requisitioners can view vendor product and service offerings, get help in selecting the correct offering, place orders, and create purchase orders. Collaborating with our vendor and requisitioner sponsor users, I conducted card sorts, sketched and reviewed alternatives, and ultimately created a 17 screen clickable wireframe mockup, of which the vendor home page is shown here.<br />
<br />
<strong>Results</strong>
<br>While this project has only just concluded, implementation of our recommendations, spanning people, process, and technology, is underway and we expect the results to include reduction of non-digital invoice submission to 16%, improvement of OCR accuracy by 59.5%, and growth in automated invoice processing first pass yield of 58%.</p>

<h2>New Hire Onboarding</h2><br>
</div>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/ML.png" />
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>
<br>My client, a large global insurance and financial services firm, has continually focused on on improving the employee digital experience, with the goal of measurably increasing satisfaction, engagement, and retention, as well as productivity, innovation, and business results. Seamless and efficient HR transactions are a key component of the their employee digital experience, spanning a wide range of touch points &mdash; including onboarding, learning and development, life events, and movement through the business. I served as program manager for a number of efforts supporting this client&#39;s employee experience transformation, including a project to redesign the onboarding experience for new hires and their hiring managers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Approach</strong>
<br>We began the New Hire Onboarding project with user research and learned that many employees find current processes to be confusing and complex. Some even likened the process to a Rube Goldberg comic. Diving in deeper, my team consisting of a UX designer, a copywriter, and a business analyst, learned that:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>New Hires say&hellip;</strong>

			<ul>
				<li>Lack of comprehensive task list</li>
				<li>No central point of contact</li>
				<li>Tasks need status updates</li>
				<li>Hard to find training materials</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td><strong>Hiring Managers say&hellip;</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Confusing Navigation</li>
				<li>Too many e-mails</li>
				<li>Tasks need status updates</li>
				<li>Too many disparate processes &amp; systems</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>These findings, coupled with the fact that...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;[our research shows that] across firms, new joiners&rsquo; experience during the first month has a disproportionate impact on their decision to stay or leave.&quot;</strong><br />
<em>Susan Steele, Executive Partner, IBM Global Business Services</em></p>

<p>...indicated that an opportunity exists to empower managers to support new hires with a consistently great experience. We moved forward through ideation and illustration of a number of potential concepts to re-envison and simplify the onboarding process resulting in a new experience that engages new hires early, streamlines a hiring manager&rsquo;s onboarding activities and uses crowdsourced mentoring to develop a sense of community.<br />
<br />

<strong>Solution</strong>
<br>Shown here is one of the screens that my team and I designed as part of the new onboarding experience. After reviewing the prototype comprised of these screens with the client, hiring managers, and new hires, we were able to deliver a proposal for the next phase, iteration on this concept resulting in detailed UX design and agile development of the new hiring and onboarding experience.</p>

<h2>Transcending Guided Flows</h2><br>
</div>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/6.png" />
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>
<br>For a Fortune 15 Telecom client, I was engagement lead and creative director for an effort to simplify their omnichannel contact center agent desktop experience. Customer service and tech support agents interacting with clients via telephone, web chat, email, and social media were encumbered by a desktop featuring upwards of 10 running applications comprising 15-20 open windows at a time. Agents spent much of their time remembering how to accomplish tasks and where to find needed information, in fact, we found that <strong>due to a lack of effective tools, up to 20% of agent time can be spent looking for information.</strong><a style="color:Gray;" href="assets/sources.html" target="_blank"><sup>2 (opens in new tab)</sup></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Approach</strong>
<br>My team, consisting of a business strategist, a user researcher, two UX designers, a visual designer, a technical architect, and a contact center SME, dove into user research and found that agents relied on many work arounds such as notepads and pens, sticky note reminders on their desks, and good old-fashioned four function calculators in order to best serve customers. Our call to action became <strong>&quot;How might we reduce the cognitive load on agents in order to enable them to focus on providing world class customer service?&quot;</strong><br />
<br />
Moving forward into a co-creation workshop in which my team, client executives, contact center agents, and front line supervisors ideated, prioritized, and paper prototyped our desired future state, the team then moved forward into iteratively designing a high fidelity prototype of the aspirational desktop agent experience, checking back with our sponsor users periodically to gain feedback towards the next iteration. Simultaneously, we mapped out the to-be processes enabling our future state experience and captured these in a service blueprint that overlays the future state customer and agent experience with the necessary process steps, desktop screens, and back-end systems necessary to enable our vision.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution & Results</strong>
<br>In the course of developing our &quot;Vision Blueprint,&quot; a beautifully printed and bound book describing the end to end effort, capturing all of our deliverables and recommendations to include UI specifications, user stories, and to-be technical architecture to hasten the subsequent agile development phase as well as static images of our clickable prototype, the team and I developed a patent-pending concept we call <em>Contextual Assistance.</em> <strong>Contextual Assistance marries the concept of guided flows with machine learning, advanced analytics-powered next best action and cognitive computing as well as cutting edge User Experience Design principles to create a new model for dynamic and modular workflow guidance.</strong> The Contextual Assistance concept became ingrained throughout our prototype and represents an exciting aproach with the potential to reinvent contact center interactions.<br />

<h2>Corporate Venture Studio</h2><br>
</div>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/GS.png"/>
<p><strong>Challenge</strong>
<br>A long-time HR Tech incumbent had charged their corporate venture capital group with finding approaches to establishing one-on-one relationships with their enterprise customers’ employees towards growing revenue by selling products and solutions directly to these consumers. In addition to sourcing potential startups to target for venture investments, leadership also wanted to try building new, adjacent, and possibly disruptive businesses to meet these goals and aimed to set up a corporate venture/startup studio.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Approach &amp; Solution</strong>
<br>I was brought in to construct and implement a venture design and build methodology for this client’s new startup studio, lead an initial opportunity and concept through the venture design phase, and to advise and coach product teams through the venture build phase.
<br>
<br>
After an extensive analysis of current approaches to product design at the firm including stakeholder interviews and gaining buy-in from across the organization, I aligned their needs and culture with best practices in corporate venture development to create and deploy an end-to-end process that would be successful given the unique cultural and political considerations that the client faced. I then educated the team, including core team members as well as SMEs from across the ~60,000-person business, on this new methodology, which integrates human centered design with lean startup and agile delivery principles, and continued transformation management activities by creating, from scratch, an internal website that served to promote the new studio and it’s approach by illustrating it’s value as well as educating employees on the new process.
<br>
<br>
While beginning to build an exhaustive idea engine and opportunity backlog, it was time to pilot the bespoke methodology. I formed and led a team through the venture design process for an existing idea to help those who recently lost their jobs get back on their feet professionally, financially, and emotionally – an incredibly salient need given the recent emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately called <i>GuideSmart&trade;</i>, the intent was to guide the newly unemployed through everything from figuring out what to do about health insurance to finding mental health support and through to landing their next job via articles, advice, templates, and rich interaction tools. A screenshot of the landing page smoke test used to validate the market for <i>GuideSmart&trade;</i> is shown above. Simultaneously, I began coaching a team that had already begun to build (notably, in the absence of a user research-influenced process) another new venture helping “active-agers” (recent but energetic and bored retirees) find work that fits their new schedules.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Results</strong>
<br>It’s time for honesty: venture design and development requires that we celebrate failure in order to enable successes. In this case, while we saw successes and gained significant validated learning, we also saw failure. In-market validation for <i>GuideSmart&trade;</i> did not succeed and the decision was made to drop this particular opportunity and build the features focused on job search, application, and interviewing into the active-ager product. Check out what's left of <i>GuideSmart&trade;</i> <a style="color:Gray;" href="https://www.facebook.com/GuideSmart-101024888419139/" target="_blank">here on the Facebook.</a><br>
    <br>
    Soon after, executive leadership decided to pivot the active ager product to serve as a job search and attainment product aimed at all job seekers, not just retirees. This product perseveres today and enjoys a Domain Authority score of 86 with over 74k backlinks, quite impressive for a startup less than a year old, especially given that Monster.com, a key competitor that has been in the market for over 22 years, scores an 88 with less than 33K backlinks while Indeed.com, possibly the market's leader, scores a 91.<a style="color:Gray;" href="assets/sources.html" target="_blank"><sup>3 (opens in new tab)</sup></a>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Update!</strong> Upon further reflection, executive leadership decided to create AI tools for what was then called <i>GuideSmart&trade;</i> and released the product as <i>Brightjump.&trade; Brightjump&trade;</i> has since won the Most Innovative Product award in Brazil, where the AI development lab is located.</p>

<h2>New Venture Design</h2><br>
</div>
<img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/badge_vert_v3copy.png" />
<p>Much of my work has involved leveraging human-centered design, Lean Startup, and agile to ideate, validate, build, and launch new businesses, both with venture-backed entrepreneurs and for large enterprises.<br />
<br />
One of my roles at IBM was as Engagement Manager and Innovation Discovery Leader for IBM Global Innovation Programs, where my team and I enabled IBM to collaborate with it&#39;s biggest and most important clients to find opportunity areas of mutual value towards creating innovative new business models for joint ventures. Top results from this work included a 50/50 joint venture with a global chemical company to provide analytics services for industrial users of water and creators of wastewater forecasting over 40MM Euro revenue in it&#39;s first year of operation and a ~1B USD cross-brand deal providing cloud analytics for a large South American bank. IBM Innovation Discovery, our approach to designing these new growth platforms included&nbsp;immersive client/IBM collaboration experiences which were fully branded with no holds barred. In one instance, a collaboration with Diageo, we brought in Chef Watson to demonstrate relevant AI/Cognitive Computing capabilities, including creating Chef Watson-developed personal cocktail recipes for each Diageo and IBM attendee. We also hired a professional mixologist to make these cocktails behind a bar dressed up as a full size replica fa&ccedil;ade of the Chef Watson food truck that IBM had brought to SXSW that year. The image here is of the name badges I created, featuring each participant&#39;s customized cocktail, part of the end to end co-branding paradigm that I designed for this collaboration.<br />
<br />
In addition to my own entrepreneurial efforts, my other work in venture design has included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Helping entrepreneurs to use Lean Startup to achieve product/market fit through to product development and launch including an app that helps expectant and new parents manage the influx of baby gifts and a second generation product that digitizes a hospitality and facilities management startup&#39;s existing product to enhance consumer engagement using the Internet of Things and Bluetooth Low Energy iBeacons.</li>
	<li>Creating a venture design approach ranging from needfinding to customer development, product innovation/management, through to company development, operating model design, stand up and operation of one of employers&#39; new digital venture development organization focused on enterprise technology. This included running design sprints and creating and validating Lean Startup MVPs for solutions such as hypercare for homeowners policy holders who have experienced a catastrophic loss, a Procure to Pay self-service and automation product, and a smarter approach to conducting background checks for large retailers of firearms to reduce risk and protect their brands, to name a few.</li>
</ul>
Across all these efforts and others, I focus initially on validating the market followed by building innovative business models and routes to market, and ultimately help these new ventures build and sustain capability for continued lean product development, agile approaches to building technology, and continuous release/DevOps. Partnerships and value chain outsourcing are of particular interest to me in these new business models, especially today when one can build a successful new company with little more than an internet connection and a credit card.
